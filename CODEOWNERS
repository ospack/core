# Note that the naming of this file is incorrect for our case: these people do not "own" the provided files but are
# people with write-access to this repository (i.e. @Ospack/core) who wish to approve changes to these files.
#
# Their review is required to merge PRs that change these files.
#
# To be explicit: we will never accept changes to this file adding people from outside the Ospack GitHub
# organisation. If you are not a Ospack maintainer: you do not personally "own" or "maintain" any formulae.
#
# Note: @Ospack/plc does not have write-access to this repository, and therefore cannot be listed in this file.
